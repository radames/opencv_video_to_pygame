# Python OpenCV Video with Pygame

Because my [code gist](https://gist.github.com/radames/1e7c794842755683162b) has a lot of comments and questions.

Here is one repository with env for reference.

Create a virtual env, activate and install requirements

~~~bash
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~


### Pygame on OSX
Using brew to install Pygame dependecies

~~~bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_gfx sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_net sdl2_ttf
~~~
